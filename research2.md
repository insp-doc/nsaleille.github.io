##### Master's thesis : statical methods to forecast macroeconomic variables (2015)

> In this thesis, we explore several short-term forecasting methods to predict the quarterly French GDP growth rate. We consider various forecasting horizons ranging from 1 to 8 month before official figure releases, and present various specifications to adress structural change and model uncertainty. We compare the performances of the most interesting models in a pseudo real-time forecasting exercise, based on a dataset containing 51 predictors.

##### EMVS, the EM approach to Bayesian Variable Selection (2015)

> The Expectation-Maximisation applied to Variable Selection algorithm (EMVS) is a nice Bayesian selection tool. Its main feature is to lower considerably the computationnal power required to estimate posterior distributions in the feature space via MCMC. The EMVS is based on the continuous spike-and-slab normal mixture model and on a closed form expression of the EM algorithm. Variable selection is achieved through two important assumptions on the spike distribution, namely continuity and a positive variance parameter that introduces sparsity in the selection process. Once posterior modes have been discovered, model evaluation is carried out in a second step using a point mass spike distribution.
