# Welcome !

![placeholder](/public/img/IMG_0636-1.jpg "Large example image")

I am a 25 years old French guy, currently living in the wonderful city of Paris. I'm curious and as such I'm interested in a wide range of topics. I studied mathematics and economics but hopefully, I'm not limited to that :-) I love discussing politics, exploring new technologies, climbing huge boulders and hitting the road in in the US, in South Africa or in Azerbaijan. 

I'm a bit of a dreamer and look forward contributing to meaningful causes to change things in a positive way. I am currently an active contributor to the awesome [Ayni project](https://ayni.in/), where I build analytic tools and algorithms to match language learners from all around the world. 

This page gathers information on my recent work and the stuff that I love to do. I hope you'll like it ! In case you'd like to reach out, visit the [contact section]({{base.url}} /contact) :-)
